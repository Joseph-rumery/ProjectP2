# ProjectP2
testT5modelT2 is the latest code that outputs the complex terms and definitions for a passage if there is a term that matches the ground truth term in the tsv file that needs to be declared in file_path. The tsv file has to be set up with a complex word in the second column that is the ground truth word to be found and the passage in the 5th column. the data that i used is from the simpletext 2023 training data(this data has the structure mentioned above) and i intended to use this data to cross check if the base model would provide any matching terms at all. testing so far has shown that there is no matches for the complex terms so the output is "No matching complex term found in Output X.".
